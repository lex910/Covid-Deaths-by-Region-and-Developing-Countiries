# STA141A-Course-Project

This data analysis project will aim to determine if being a developing country and being in a specific region of the world is correlated to different mean death rate percentages due to the COVID-19 Pandemic. The COVID-19 data is obtained from the World Heath Organization and an additional source was used to classify countries as developed or developing. There are two factors that are being analyzed to see whether they effect death rate percentages. Factor A is classification with 2 levels (developed and developing) and factor B is region with 6 levels (Americas, Eastern Mediterranean, Western Pacific, South-East Asia, Africa, and Europe). First we will perform descriptive analysis and data visualization to obtain our data set and understand the distribution. Next, we fit the data set to a two way ANOVA model to further understand how region and classification effect death rates due to COVID 19 in countries. A logistic regression model will also be fit for prediction. Lastly, sensitivity analysis is performed to ensure that the dataset meets the assumptions of the model.
